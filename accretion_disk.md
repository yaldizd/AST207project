The first hints of black holes came from the study of binary star systems. Cygnus X-1, discovered in 1964, was identified as a potential black hole due to its intense X-ray emissions. These emissions arise as matter spirals into the black hole, heating up and radiating energy.

\paragraph{Accretion Disk Theory.}
Matter forms a disk as it spirals into a black hole. The energy radiated by this disk is described by:
\[
L \propto \dot{M} \frac{c^2}{r}
\]
where \( \dot{M} \) is the mass accretion rate and \( r \) is the radius.

\subsection*{Relativistic Jets}
Observations of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) revealed powerful jets of particles emitted from regions near black holes. The Penrose process explains how rotational energy of a black hole can power such jets.
