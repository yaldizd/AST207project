Black holes usually cannot be observed directly on account of both their small size and the fact that they emit no light. They can be “observed,” however, by the effects of their enormous gravitational fields on nearby matter. For example, if a black hole is a member of a binary star system, matter flowing into it from its companion becomes intensely heated and then radiates X-rays copiously before entering the event horizon of the black hole and disappearing forever. One of the component stars of the binary X-ray system Cygnus X-1 is a black hole. Discovered in 1971 in the constellation Cygnus, this binary consists of a blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun that revolve about one another in a period of 5.6 days.

The first hints of black holes came from the study of binary star systems. Cygnus X-1, discovered in 1964, was identified as a potential black hole due to its intense X-ray emissions. These emissions arise as matter spirals into the black hole, heating up and radiating energy.

\paragraph{Accretion Disk Theory.}
Matter forms a disk as it spirals into a black hole. The energy radiated by this disk is described by:
\[
L \propto \dot{M} \frac{c^2}{r}
\]
where \( \dot{M} \) is the mass accretion rate and \( r \) is the radius.

\subsection*{Relativistic Jets}
Observations of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) revealed powerful jets of particles emitted from regions near black holes. The Penrose process explains how rotational energy of a black hole can power such jets.
