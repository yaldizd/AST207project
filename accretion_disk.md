title: The Discovery of Cygnus X-1 via its Accretion Disk

In 1964, a rocket carrying X-ray Geiger counters was launched. These Geiger counters conducted a survey of a 8.4$$\deg$$ patch of the night sky near the galactic core, in the 1-15 Å range. The 1965 paper analyzing the survey by Bowyer et. al. was the first observational evidence for the existance of black holes. The object Cygnus X-1 emitted X-rays best explained by a black hole being present there.

The paper wasn't too confident in their findings and had many other objects mentioned alongside Cyg X-1, but this particular system kept being observed and is considered the first discovered black hole.

In his 1988 book 'A Brief History of Time', Stephen Hawking wrote:

>I have a bet with Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology that in fact Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole! This is a form of insurance policy for me. I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. But in that case, I would have the consolation of winning my bet, which would bring me four years of the magazine Private Eye. If black holes do exist, Kip will get one year of Penthouse. When we made the bet, in 1975, we were 80 percent certain that Cygnus was a black hole. By now, I would say that we are about 95 percent certain, but the bet has yet to be settled.



As mentioned before, black holes cannot be observed directly because they emit no light of their own. They can be “observed”, however, by their accretion disks. When a black hole is in a binary star system, the matter being absorbed by it from its companion becomes intensely heated and then radiates X-rays before entering the event horizon of the black hole and disappearing forever. One of the component stars of the binary X-ray system Cygnus X-1 is a black hole. Discovered in 1971 in the constellation Cygnus, this binary consists of a blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun that revolve about one another in a period of 5.6 days.

The first hints of black holes came from the study of binary star systems. Cygnus X-1, discovered in 1964, was identified as a potential black hole due to its intense X-ray emissions. These emissions arise as matter spirals into the black hole, heating up and radiating energy.

\paragraph{Accretion Disk Theory.}
Matter forms a disk as it spirals into a black hole. The energy radiated by this disk is described by:
\[
L \propto \dot{M} \frac{c^2}{r}
\]
where \( \dot{M} \) is the mass accretion rate and \( r \) is the radius.

\subsection*{Relativistic Jets}
Observations of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) revealed powerful jets of particles emitted from regions near black holes. The Penrose process explains how rotational energy of a black hole can power such jets.
