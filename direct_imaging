The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first image of a black hole in the galaxy M87. The bright ring corresponds to photons orbiting the black hole's event horizon, and its size agrees with the Schwarzschild radius calculated using:
\[
\theta = \frac{R_s}{D}
\]
where \( \theta \) is the angular diameter, \( R_s \) is the Schwarzschild radius, and \( D \) is the distance to the black hole.
