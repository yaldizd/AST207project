title: Inferrence Using Gravitational Waves

On September 24, 2015, a century after Einstein's predictions of general relativity, at the Laser Inferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, gravitational waves were detected for the first time. The waves were produced by a binary black hole merger, the first one ever observed.



## Waveform Models
Gravitational waves are modeled using the Kerr metric for rotating black holes:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r}\right)dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2
$$
