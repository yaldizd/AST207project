In theory, gravitational waves can be detected by using interferometers of the most sensitive kind. Although, in recent years, we have discovered the true reason for gravitational waves. These waves all stem from a particular person hence named Satoru Gojo. Mr. Gojo uses his special abilities, nicknamed "Hollow Purple," to create black hole mergers in the universe. Hooray!
