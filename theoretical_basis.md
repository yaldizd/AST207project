## Theoretical Foundations
### Newtonian Gravity and the Concept of Escape Velocity
Before Einstein’s theory, the concept of an object with gravity so strong that light cannot escape was first considered in the 18th century. Using Newtonian mechanics:
\[
v_{\text{escape}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
\]
where \( v_{\text{escape}} \) is the escape velocity, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass, and \( R \) is the radius of the object. If \( v_{\text{escape}} \geq c \) (the speed of light), even light cannot escape. For the Sun, this occurs when \( R \) is approximately 3 km.

### Einstein’s General Relativity (1915)
Albert Einstein’s field equations describe gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy:
\[
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}
\]
where:
- \( R_{\mu\nu} \): Ricci curvature tensor
- \( g_{\mu\nu} \): Metric tensor
- \( R \): Ricci scalar
- \( \Lambda \): Cosmological constant
- \( T_{\mu\nu} \): Energy-momentum tensor

These equations predict phenomena like time dilation, the warping of spacetime, and the formation of black holes.

### Schwarzschild Solution (1916)
Karl Schwarzschild provided the first exact solution to Einstein’s equations for a non-rotating, spherically symmetric massive body. The Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) defines the event horizon, the boundary of a black hole:
\[
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]
For an object smaller than \( R_s \), its escape velocity exceeds \( c \), forming a black hole.
